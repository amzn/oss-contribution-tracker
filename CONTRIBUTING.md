## Bugs

Bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome. When filing a bug, try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The date/commit of the code you're running
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome!

You should open an issue to discuss your pull request, unless it's a trivial change. It's best to ensure that your proposed change would be accepted so that you don't waste your own time.

Pull requests should generally be opened against **master**.

## Tests

Please ensure that your change still passes unit tests, and ideally integration/UI tests. It's OK if you're still working on tests at the time that you submit, but be prepared to be asked about them.

## Code style

Follow standard JavaScript conventions. Two-space indents, for example; note how existing code is formatted and match that. This project ships an `.editorconfig` file that can assist you if your IDE or editor supports it. If your editor supports ESLint, even better -- we have an `eslintrc` with style rules.

Otherwise, you should use the following:

  * Spaces, not tabs
  * Indent size of two (2) spaces
  * No trailing whitespaces
  * Use single quotes (') in JavaScript and double quotes (") in JSX

This will grow and change with the project. If there is something in particular that you want to see added/changed open an issue on GitHub.
